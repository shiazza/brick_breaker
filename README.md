Flame is a Flutter-based 2D game engine. In this codelab, you will build a game inspired by one of the classics of â€˜70s video games, Steve Wozniak's Breakout. You will use Flame's Components, to draw the bat, ball, and bricks. You will utilize Flame's Effects to animate the bat's movement and see how to integrate Flame with Flutter's state management system.

When complete, your game should look like this.
